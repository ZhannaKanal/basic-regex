Regular Expression or a regex
are a feature supported by many different programming languages.
A regular expression is a special syntax to create a "pattern", which you can then use to check against a string, extract text, or more.
Basic regular expression:
const regex = /freeCodeCamp/;
This particular regular expression will match the text freeCodeCamp, with capital C's, anywhere in a string.
test() method is present on RegExp objects, which are objects representing a regular expression(such as the one we just defined).
The test() method accepts a string, which is the string to test for matches against the regular expression. 
const regex = /freeCodeCamp/;
const test = regex.test("e");
console.log(test);
test() method returned false because the string e doesnot match the pattern freeCodeCamp. Even though the pattern freeCodeCamp includes the letter e, that's the opposite direction of how regular expressions work.
F/e:
const regex = /freeCodeCamp/;
console.log(regex.test("freeCodeCamp")); //true
console.log(regex.test("freeCodeCamp is great")); //true
console.log(regex.test("I love freeCodeCamp")); //true
console.log(regex.test("freecodecamp")); //false
console.log(regex.test("FREECODECAMP")); //false
console.log(regex.test("free")); // false
console.log(regex.test("code")); //false 
console.log(regex.test("camp")); //false
The test() method returns a boolean, indicating whether the string matches the regular expression at all.

match() method accepts a regular expression, although you can also pass a string which will be constructed into a regular expression.
match() returns the match array for the string.
const regex = /freeCodeCamp/;
const match = "freeCodeCamp".match(regex);
console.log(match);
If we run it, we get an array back. But it's a strange looking array.
[
    'freeCodeCamp',
    index: 0,
    input: 'freeCodeCamp',
    groups: undefined
]
The groups property would show any captured groups. 
The index property tells you at what character in the string the match was found. In our case , it's the beginning of the string.
The input property tells you the string the match() method was called on.
