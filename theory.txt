Regular Expression or a regex
are a feature supported by many different programming languages.
A regular expression is a special syntax to create a "pattern", which you can then use to check against a string, extract text, or more.
Basic regular expression:
const regex = /freeCodeCamp/;
This particular regular expression will match the text freeCodeCamp, with capital C's, anywhere in a string.
test() method is present on RegExp objects, which are objects representing a regular expression(such as the one we just defined).
The test() method accepts a string, which is the string to test for matches against the regular expression.
